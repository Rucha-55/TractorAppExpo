# mDojo Single Notification System Setup Guide

## Overview
This notification system automatically schedules **ONE notification** 2-5 days after app installation for the mDojo employee feedback chatbot app.

## How It Works

### 1. Installation Detection
- When the app is opened for the first time, the install date is saved
- Uses AsyncStorage with key `app_install_date` to store the date

- **One Time Only**: Each user receives only one notification after installation
- **Welcome Message**: Friendly introduction to mDojo employee feedback chatbot

Android requires the following permissions:
```json
"permissions": [
  "POST_NOTIFICATIONS",
  "SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM", 
  "USE_EXACT_ALARM",
  "RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED",
  "VIBRATE"
]
```

    title: 'Your custom title',
    body: 'Your custom message',
    data: { type: 'welcome-reminder', days: randomDays },
  },
  // ... rest of the code
});
```

### To Change Timing Range:
Modify the random days calculation:

```javascript
// For 1-3 days range
const randomDays = 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);

// For 3-7 days range  
const randomDays = 3 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 5);
```
